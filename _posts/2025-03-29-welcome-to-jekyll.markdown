My name is Jean Costello; I'm a postdoc at Boston University in the Department of Public Health. 

My current research projects involve the health effects of aircraft noise pollution and environmental exposures in Gulf War Veterans.
During my PhD at University of California, San Francisco, I studied the associations between air pollution and preterm birth. I also supported research into refugee camps by analyzing patterns between distance to health facilities and infant mortality.

I try to do all of my geospatial work in R and python so that I can easily reproduce and share my work. I plan to upload some of my notes and tutorials here!
